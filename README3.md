# **THE BLOCKCHAIN**
---
The blockchain and the  Cryptocurrencies also known as digital curency assets play an increasingly significant role in this modern newer economy.In finance sectors as in other sectors, companies are adapting to this new change in technology and data storage. 

Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have a variety of uses, such as supply chain management and health information exchange, but their most significant role today is as financial instruments and means of trade. This creates alternative financial systems that replace traditional centralized control models with more transparent and automated finance networks reliant on a distributed, consensus based governance structure(follow the digital money)

## overview on cryptocurrency
     A cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
     When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. since cryptocurrency play a role in the economy, the modest exposure to traditional asset classes like currencies, commodities, stocks, and macroeconomic factors, have an impact(cryptocurrency)

### **definition**
 *According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:*
***  
1.The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.     
2.The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.  
3.The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.  
4.Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.  
5.The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.            
6.If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them(cryptocurrency).

# **Blockchain**

<P>The blockchain only contains validated transactions, which prevents fraudulent transactions and double spending of the currency(hash).</P> The blockchain record could be a list of transactions, but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory. The information in the blockchain are  stored electronically in digital format(blockchain facts:what is it,how it works,and how it can be used)

<P>For organizations across the globe blockchain represents a completely new way to think about data and operating models(finacial services infrastructure).These applications rely on cryptography to create digital assets and cryptocurrencies that can be shared securely through blockchain based transactions(follow the digital money).</P>
<P>The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party. 
The difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities,when filled,it is then linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain.A database usually structures its data into tables(blockchain facts:what is it,how it works,and how it can be used).</P>

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued an interpretive letter 1174 endorsing the integration of distributed ledger technology (DLT)-enabled applications with existing banking operations, including the deployment of stable coins and extension of banks’ payments related activities. This endorsement signals that banks need to take stable coins and DLT-enabled financial applications seriously if they want to remain competitive and meet evolving client demands(finacial services infrastructure)

According to investopedia, blockchain has many benefit and also has downside. it's benefit are; accuracy of the chain, cost reductions, decentralization, efficient transactions, private transactions, secure transactions, transparency, banking the unbanked. some downside are; technology cost, speed and data inefficiency, illegal activity, ad regulation

companies have now start to use this new technology.companies like Walmart(WMT) that uses blockchain to ensure food safety and tracing products back to he farm or larger corporations such as Microsoft(MSFT),Paypal(PYPL),Starbucks(SBUX),Salesforce(CRM), and IBM use blockchain for digital security,infrastructure,automation(Best blockchain ETFs: Here’s how you can invest in the backbone of crypto)

### **Conclusin**
While there are a lot of changes in finance sector now days, companies that lavarage this newer technology prove to see positive income
